This is an Applied Data Science Capstone Project Notebook. For questions send a note to mbehara@AdelleTech.com 

Regarding the data files here: This Project Requires utilizing FourSquare APIs, but in the business of Web services (incl. REST APIs), what we have are generally blackboxes and there's not enough time to get the administrators open taps. Hence I store data to quickly create a loopback or mock Web services to finish unit testing.
